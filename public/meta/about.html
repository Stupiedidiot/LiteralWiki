                <p>Hello there! This website is being developed by a single person. You might be wondering, why am I making this wiki in neocities of all places? Why not use something like Fandom.com? I only really have few reasons why.</p>

                <h3>Full customization.</h3>
                <p>I get to edit every tiny aspect of the website. This also means it can be completely free from advertisements and unnecessary popups.</p>

                <h3>Unoptimized SEO.</h3>
                <p>This might sound strange, but I would prefer if LiteralHat never makes it big. There's a special quality in his work that I don't think a mass audience can will appreciate. If you happen to find this site, it means you are really looking.</p>
                
                <h3>Too Poor for Hosting</h3>
                <p>Yeah.</p>
                
                <hr>
                <p>Of course, there are some setbacks of this method. I'd have to code everything myself and, unlike a traditional wiki, people can't contribute content directly themselves. Regardless I will try my best.</p>
                <p class="txt-red">Please remember to be respectful of Charlie and his creations.</p>
