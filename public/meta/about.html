        <p>Hello there! This website is worked on with the literalhat community and maintained by a single person. You might be wondering, why am I making this wiki in neocities of all places? Why not use something like Fandom.com? There are really have few reasons why.</p>

        <h3>Full customization.</h3>
        <p>I get to edit every tiny aspect of the website. This also means it can be completely free from advertisements and unnecessary popups.</p>

        <h3>Unoptimized SEO.</h3>
        <p>If you happen to find this site, it means you are really looking.</p>
        
        <h3>Too Poor for Hosting</h3>
        <p>Yeah.</p>
        
        <hr>
        <p>Of course, there are some setbacks of this method. I'd have to code everything myself and, unlike a traditional wiki, people can't contribute content directly themselves. Regardless I will try my best.</p>
        <p class="txt-red">Please remember to be respectful of Charlie and his creations.</p>

        Updating this website is a hobby of mine, so apologies for the lack of professionalism.
