                I don't want it all<br>
                Make it big then show off all my ego<br>
                To the world that's had enough of all this bullshit<br>
                And I'm just choking trying to stay afloat<br><br>

                I would rather die<br>
                Slit my throat than be your online idol<br>
                That you praise, then kiss, then dump, then kick<br>
                Into the dirt with all the others<br>
                All the toys you no longer find fun<br><br>

                I don't want it all<br>
                I don't want it all<br><br>

                I don't want it all<br>
                I don't want it all<br>
                I don't want it all<br>
                I don't want it all<br>

                We live in a world<br>
                Holding the hope that one of us can come<br>
                And save us from the world's disasters<br>
                Were leading our necks with martingale ties<br>
                But when the missiles come<br>
                There will be nobody else to look up to<br><br>

                All Your Idols Will Be Dead<br>
                All Your Idols Will Be Dead<br>
                All Your Idols Will Be Dead<br>
                All Your Fucking Idols Will Be Dead
