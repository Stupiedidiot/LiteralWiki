                [Spoken]<br>
                Once Upon a time, there lived this two people, on top of penthouse, on the top of a hill<br>
                Their names were Adeline and Ari, and they were absolutely obsessed with each other<br>
                Infatuated, even<br><br>
                
                They lived in the shadow of pure love<br>
                Adeline and Ari, they weren't nice to each other<br>
                I'm sorry I guess got you fooled<br>
                It didn't have to end on such a tragic fragile note<br>
                They fell right into the abyss of love<br><br>
                
                [Spoken]<br>
                And it didn't come as a surprise, when another man snatch Adeline away and married her<br>
                He gave her flowers, dresses, riches, anything a girl could ever want!<br>
                But often, a ring will choke your heart<br>
                'Honor one another above yourselves.'<br><br>
                
                Fly so high, a pretty star<br>
                That Shone too bright and cold<br>
                Bell toll as our birdy sings<br>
                To fool herself<br>
                
                Ari boy, Ari dear! Where have you been???<br>
                You swore you'll always stay right here!<br>
                He lifts her chin, she holds onto the shadow<br>
                That clip her wings from the very start<br><br>
                
                [Spoken]<br>
                Well, Ari looked at her, then laughed<br>
                She always saw him in her sleep, watching from above<br>
                And he always knew there wouldn't be another way<br><br>
                
                You see nothing good exists in Ari's world<br>
                Just failures of society, greed, lust, money, power<br>
                I'm not sure if they can truly love<br>
                
                Adeline and Ari, both birds in a flame<br>
                It's a story we could never change<br>
                Keeps his distance to watch her disappear<br>
                She doesn't see him, but he's always there<br><br>
                
                Adeline and Ari, they weren't nice to each other<br>
                It's okay, he will always have her<br>
                They lived in the top of a broken penthouse<br>
                They fell right into the abyss of love
