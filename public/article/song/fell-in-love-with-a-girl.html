            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                Fell in love with a girl<br>
                I fell in love once and almost completely<br>
                She's in love with the world<br>
                But sometimes, these feelings can be so misleading<br>
                She turns and says, "Are you alright?"<br>
                I said, "I must be fine 'cause my heart's still beating"<br>
                "Come and kiss me by the riverside, yeah<br>
                Bobby says it's fine, he don't consider it cheating, now"<br><br>

                Red hair with a curl<br>
                Mello-Roll for the flavor, and the eyes were peeping<br>
                Can't keep away from the girl<br>
                These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting<br><br>

                Can't think of anything to do, yeah<br>
                My left brain knows that all love is fleeting<br>
                She's just looking for something new, yeah<br>
                I said it once before, but it bears repeating now<br><br>

                Ah, ah<br>
                Ah, ah<br>
                Ah, ah<br>
                Ah, ah<br><br>
