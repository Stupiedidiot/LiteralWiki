            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                Well remember that time when it was just the two of us<br>
                Awake in the middle of the night and everyone else was asleep<br>
                You held my hand and I held yours<br>
                And we both smiled to each other<br>
                But clearly you had something else on your mind<br>
                Because I was 7 years old<br><br>

                ‘Cuz I was so naïve<br>
                To even think that I could trust you with my own body<br>
                And I know you never got caught but did you know that hell is kinda scary<br><br>

                I hate you so much ‘cuz you just ruined my life like that<br>
                And I know you always deny it because you’re a douchebag<br>
                Remember when you lied in court and lied to us about mom<br>
                And I just know you’d never take the blame because you’re a fucking asshole and no one likes you and you’re going to hell<br><br>

                ‘Cuz every single gift you bought us was really just a makeshift Band-Aid<br>
                To hide the fact that you were never really a father<br>
                Maybe my memory is shit because you never fed us quite as well as yourself<br>
                But at least I remember all the things you did to me<br><br>

                You know there was this one room in the old house we lived in<br>
                That you’d lock us inside of because we were never good enough for you<br>
                It kinda reminds me of the time in hospital because they had to make sure I didn’t fuckin’ neck myself<br>
                Well at least the food was pretty good, I ate like 8 sandwiches<br>
                Never picked me up from school when I tried to kill myself on recess<br>
                Teachers don’t believe you when they think you’re just a troubled boy<br><br>

                Even sister blames you for our brother’s death<br>
                Because you never were quite good to him at all<br>
                And clearly you didn’t learn a thing from him doing a backflip off a building, fuckin’ 720 degrees that shit<br>
                ‘Cuz the only thing you cared about that month was getting baptised since you’ll knew you’d go to hell<br>
                Right with your own dad who fucked a chicken, what?<br><br>

                And then there’s mom, who you hit who you blame for your own falls<br>
                Look at her now she’s a fragile porcelain doll<br>
                Without a goal because you’re a controlling, abusive, narcissistic, sack of shit bastard who really just deserves to rot in hell<br>
                Kneel and pray go to church read the bible all you want<br>
                If you’re lucky even God might actually forgive you<br>
                Otherwise I’ll see you in hell for writing this song, bitch<br><br>

                And they always tell me that<br>
                We’re all family and we should try and get along right<br>
                Because we’re all connected by blood<br>
                But I guess it’s too bad because past a certain age<br>
                Your kids will learn enough to figure out what’s really going on<br>
                And that’s when you’ll be in trouble<br>
                Wonder when you’re old if any of your kids will talk to you again<br>
                Consider the possibility that you’re the one who’s a fucking stain<br><br>

                Of shit to all our lives do us all a favour and just fucking kill yourself<br>
                Stick a shotgun up your mouth and pull the trigger<br>
                Cos when you’re old and no one cares for you no more<br>
                It’ll be way too late to fix it all<br>
                But that is if you’re assuming it’s not too late already to fix it now… that’s funny<br><br>

                When you die and hopefully youlll die soon you'll be all alone<br>
                And I wouldn’t even want to pay for your headstone<br>
                But if you had one, for some reason? I'll draw a fucking dick on it because that's what you were to us our whole lives, you were just a dick I hope you suck Satan’s cock in hell
