            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                Remember the day when we first met<br>
                Your very first words were 'appreciated'<br>
                Didn't think you'd ever stay<br>
                And now you've become degenerated<br><br>

                But god, I'm so glad<br>
                To have met you in this stupid lifeline<br>
                Your music and your post it notes<br>
                Your scribbly, clean cut font designs<br><br>

                From late night horror movie streams<br>
                And awful FNAF fanfiction (oh god)<br>
                Your Catholic life's a living meme<br>
                Why can't God save us all?<br><br>

                I'm sorry you had to expirence<br>
                The cringe of early MHTP<br>
                But I hope you do persue your dreams<br>
                And make your history<br><br>

                It's funny sometimes how you just vanisih<br>
                For weeks on end cos you're probably playing Valornat<br>
                And suddenly you just kinda prosper<br>
                As if you've always been here, you asian imposter<br><br>

                But god, were so glad<br>
                to have met you in this stupid server<br>
                Your doorknob sucking behavior<br>
                The hatred for your local pastor<br><br>

                You're lyric writing mastermind<br>
                with a kick-ass repertoire<br>
                Improvised, yet so refined<br>
                Its almost quite bizzare<br><br>

                I really hope you see your worth<br>
                Cos youre really quite a special one<br>
                Happy fucking birthday Ben<br>
                Our roadtrip's just begun<br><br>

                Someday you're going to come to Australia<br>
                And really realise how fucked you are<br>
                But it's okay cos I'll be with you<br>
                In a shitty second hand car<br><br>

                And ohh we can drive<br>
                Across the boring fucking orange outback<br>
                On a blasting Honda stereo<br>
                And a never ending Youtube soundtrack<br><br>

                At the end I must say that i am<br>
                Really quite damn proud of you<br>
                Cos even though you say you're lost<br>
                You always push right through<br><br>

                I wasn't going to write a song<br>
                But I didn't know what to fucking draw<br>
                So happy ducking birthday Ben<br>
                From Marla, me, and all
