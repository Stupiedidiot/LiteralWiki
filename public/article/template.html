            Hello, this is a template page for anyone who'd like to contribute their own pages (and for me when i forget my own code lol). The title will be automatically added in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beside me is a profile box. You add a 1:1 image alongside a table with data on the bottom.
        </p>

        <div id="sub">
            <h2>Headers</h2>
            <p>
                The headers whithin this div dictates what will appear in the side navigation. 'h2' tags are important stuff while 'h3' is anything related to it.
            </p>

            <h3>Subheader 1</h3>
            <p>
                You can add as many subheaders you's like! Keep in mind that they must have unique names, or else it won't anchor properly. Just make sure to always start with a 'h2' tag or it till break (I swear I'll fix that eventually).
            </p>

            <!--Add images with a the class 'image' because yeah-->
            <img class="image" src="./media/art/1676409-early bird.png" alt="Image Caption">
            <h3>Subheader 2</h3>
            <p>You can add images that will stay at the right side. The 'alt' will be the caption of the image. Use an 'hr' tag with the class of 'clear' to add a invisible boundary for float elements.</p>

            <hr class="clear"> <!--The aforementioned hr tag-->

            <h3>Subheader 3</h3>
            <p>It will ensure that the text after the 'hr' tag will stay uneffected. Sectioning things with normal 'hr' tags isn't necessary but it does help things long neater.</p>

            <hr>

            <h2>Attatchments</h2>
            <h3>Gallery</h3>
            <p>Still working on this</p>

            <h2>Links and References</h2>
            <h3>Own Articles</h3>
            <p>
                To link pages that are whithin the site, just <a data-ref="hat">do this</a>.
                It will go through the articles we have and automatically link it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Leaving the inside of the lilnk blank will automatically add the thing you are referencing: <a data-ref="marla"></a>
            </p>

            <p>When making new pages, please make sure it's all in lowercaps.</p>

            <h3>Outside Link</h3>
            <p>
                To link outside sources just use this! <sup data-ref="https://youtu.be/THZ_M926Eck?si=nvTjnflZpEnuM9eJ">Reference Name</sup> 
                It will automatically sort it self numerically! at the bottom of the page
            </p>
            <p>
                Just add the link you're referencing to in 'data-ref'<sup data-ref="https://literalhat.com/funny.php">Remember to Link</sup>
            </p>
            <p>
                Leaving it as '#' will state that it is missing.<sup data-ref="#">This link is Missing</sup>
            </p>

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>It isn't a perfect system and I wouldn't blame anyone for not wanting to take part in it. With this in mind, I give you all full permission to copy the content here and host it in an actual wiki site. The more people archiving, the better :D</p>

            <p>This entire website is loosely held together glue and sticks but I suppose that is just the neocities way,,</p>
