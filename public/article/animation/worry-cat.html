            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                Life of a worry-cat, sorry-cat blues<br>
                Claws hung up on the post, contract's overdue<br>
                Through slitted eyes, these papers all seem the same<br>
                But kitty cat's still signing his worthless name<br><br>

                Life of a worry-cat, sorry-cat hold on that<br>
                Thought that you're small and invisible<br>
                Crystal spheres full of stars and no places to run<br>
                Just stand there with a gaze irresistible<br><br>

                Worry-cat blues come in living bills<br>
                You know your brother in law makes 7 whole figures<br>
                Maybe I could get there with a little overtime<br>
                As long as we're cracked we're already floating<br><br>

                Sorry cat, worry that I couldn't afford<br>
                The lights are flickering out and the roaches are wakened<br>
                But we already get it, you're worth so much more<br>
                With triple insulation and marble floors<br><br>

                Life of a worry-cat, sorry-cat hold on that<br>
                Thought that you're small and invisible<br>
                Crystal spheres full of stars and no places to run<br>
                Just stand there with a gaze irresistible<br><br>

                Leap with your fullest grace<br>
                Away from blocks of enterprise you should've hate<br>
                Your fault in the first place<br>
                That you didn't spring 'till now, but it's not too late<br>
                A rat race game to the end, in the end where glory yells and calls<br>
                You'll make it through to the end, in the end where nothing matters at all<br><br>

                Life of a poppy-cat, candy-cat blues<br>
                Wish I took the chance but I hadn't nothing to lose<br>
                Myself in minty dried pastures and mountains of booze<br>
                The world could nuke itself and make for such a spirited view<br><br>
                
                Life of a worry-cat, sorry-cat finding plateaus<br>
                In your work unacceptable<br>
                Performance reviews identically say<br>
                That your podium in life is replaceable<br><br>

                Life of the worry-cat, copy-cat fight for the<br>
                Fact that you're worth more than a decimal<br>
                Complain about grey numbers on a gridded plane<br>
                Rose tinted turns the green into rich champange<br><br>

                Life of a worry-cat, copy-cat blues<br>
                Chain up your tie and take abuse<br>
                'Cuz even if he wanted to roar<br>
                For a raise he didn't think he deserved it before

                <h3>Interpretation</h3>
                <p>The song is a criticism against capitalism and the way it effects a person's perceived self-worth. Worry Cat is wasting his life away, doing repetitive tasks, in hopes to earn enough money to finally achieve the ideal life.</p>
