            <p>
                The title card begins with a hog gracefully playing the violin to the song's tune. Hat, presumably a farmer, goes on his usual hunting for rabbits for his rabbit pie. There is a sequence where he chases a certain rabbit with his farmer’s rifle, ultimately giving up trying to chase it and replacing his dish with a wolf. The rabbits eventually multiply due to the missing wolf, and showcases the numerous animals on Hat’s farm in the segment. After hearing a goat’s commotion, Hat checks on the animals and is chased down by the herd of rabbits, the initial rabbit even taking a bite on his arm. In the last scene, that rabbit sits by Hat’s rifle and top hat.
