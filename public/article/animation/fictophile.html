            <p>An animation introducing <a data-ref="aveline">Aveline</a> and <a data-ref="art">Art</a> for the first time publicly in video format. The song is performed by Aveline, where she recalls her experiences in stardom. To cope with the burnout from excessive work, she resorts to drugs.</p>
            <p>Aveline is deeply in love with Art, who seems to be indifferent to her.</p>

            <h2>Lyrics</h2>
            <p>
                She said it's not my fault<br>
                That it all fell down<br>
                So close your windows, lock your doors<br>
                I can't help feeling I'm forgetting something<br>
                You used to paint me pictures now<br>
                You only paint my wall<br>
                I'm worried that I've started something<br>
                Built on lies and alcohol<br>
                I want to sit down on the floor<br>
                Become a worn out metaphor<br>
                But still there's something, probably nothing<br>
                That brings a phaser to my door<br>
                No use to count the times that I've woken up past ten<br>
                I tell myself what's done is done<br>
                But I know I'll drink next week again<br>
                I suggest we let things rest<br>
                Till I come down or until you drown<br>
                Cause you're all I've got left in this town<br>
                And I need time and you need wine<br>
                So grab a jacket, grab your phone<br>
                I've heard it's pretty cold outside<br><br>

                I suggest we let things rest<br>
                Till I come down or until you drown<br>
                Cause you're all I've got left in this town<br>
                And I need time and you need wine<br>
                So grab a jacket, grab your phone<br>
                I've heard it's pretty cold outside
            </p>
