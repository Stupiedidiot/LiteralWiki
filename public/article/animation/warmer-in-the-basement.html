The photographs featured were numbers 01, 19, 69, 85, and 336. With the former looking similar to the woman featured in the previous animation, <a data-ref="absolute-territory"></a>.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This animation is often unlisted or privated from Charlie's Youtube Channel. It has the following as the description:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Hi. I no longer associate with this video. The period in which this was made is a great source of hurt / trauma for me, but it remains uploaded for archival purposes.<br><br>

                I would rather not deny that I was once a misogynist, racist, and generally a piece of shit. At the time I lacked positive role models and was surrounded by the wrong people.<br><br>

                If you find yourself resonating with this video, I do not consider you a viewer or a part of my audience.
            </blockquote>
