        <p>One of the earliest video featuring <a data-ref="hat"></a> and <a data-ref="chicken"></a> posted on the 2th of April 2020. It is animated to the song "Absolute Territory" by Ken Ashcorp and was created using Adobe Flash CS3.</p>

            <h2>Video Outline</h2>
            <p>The animation begins with Hat stalking Chicken Man who was interacting with another woman. This prompts Hat to approach the woman and physically assault her. Hat stabs her repeatedly while Chicken Man looks on incredibly disappointed. Chicken Man's body language implies that he is fully aware of Hat's intention of approaching prior to the assault.</p>

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This animation is often unlisted or privated from Charlie's Youtube Channel. It has the following as the description:</p>
            <blockquote>
                Hi. I no longer associate with this video. The period in which this was made is a great source of hurt / trauma for me, but it remains uploaded for archival purposes.<br><br>

                I would rather not deny that I was once a misogynist, racist, and generally a piece of shit. At the time I lacked positive role models and was surrounded by the wrong people.<br><br>

                If you find yourself resonating with this video, I do not consider you a viewer or a part of my audience.
